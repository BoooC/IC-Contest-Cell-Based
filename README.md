# IC Design Contest Submissions

This repository contains my submissions for the IC Design Contest. 
You can find more information about the contest [here](https://moeisoc.web2.ncku.edu.tw/p/406-1166-211155,r11.php?Lang=zh-tw). 
Each folder corresponds to the respective year's competition and includes problem statements, RTL (Register-Transfer Level) code, synthesis reports, and other relevant files.

## 2023 Submission: LASER
The key objective for 2023 was to use iterative methods to find two circles that could cover the maximum number of target points.
There are two versions of the circuit:

- **4-Processor Version:**
  - Area: 23614.2 um²
  - Cycle Count: 56574
  - All patterns passed successfully.

- **8-Processor Version:**
  - Area: 28246.4 um²
  - Cycle Count: 112894
  - All patterns passed successfully.


#### Grade A Standards for 2023:
- Area < 37,000 um²
- Gate-Level and RTL simulation must be completely accurate under a clock cycle of 8 ns.


## 2022 Submission: JAM
The focus for 2022 was on implementing the lexicographical permutation algorithm in a circuit.

- **Circuit Design:**
  - Area: 8337.6 um²
  - Cycle Count: 362877
  - All patterns passed successfully.


### Grade A Standards for 2022:

- Gate-Level and RTL simulation must be completely accurate under a clock cycle of 10 ns.
- Total simulation cycle count < 430,000 cycles.
- Area < 10,000 um²
